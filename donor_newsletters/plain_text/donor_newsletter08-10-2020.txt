﻿Behind the Scenes at Activate Good

July marked the end of Emily McDaniel's time with us as our amazing Youth
Programs Coordinator. We are thinking of her and wishing her all the best
in her future life and family adventures!

Emily helped grow our [13]Teens Change the World! Summer Program, form
partnerships with more schools to inspire youth service, and more. We look
forward to staying in touch with this member of the "Activate Good family"!

[15]Operation Access: Part 2!

You might recall that back in April, Activate Good partnered with
the [16]Wake County Public School System for "Operation Access", an effort
to set up 10,500 wireless hot spots to ensure all students have reliable
internet access and can continue to participate in their remaining spring
classes. We’re partnering once again to bring another BIG IMPACT project to
life! The transition to remote classes during the Coronavirus pandemic
means access to supporting technology at home is even more critical. For
[17]Operation Access Part 2, volunteers will help hand out 40,000+
Chromebook laptops and 10,000 hotspots to students and families across 5
different sites in Wake County to ensure all students have reliable
technology access and can participate in classes! Distribution starts
August 17 - [18]volunteer sign ups happening NOW!

Help us spread the word! Read volunteer information and safety requirements
[19]HERE. Volunteers [20]must register to participate. Volunteers are
encouraged (but not required) to sign up for multiple shifts to minimize
contact.

[22]United We Help

This year, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Activate Good is
continuing its tradition of honoring those lost on September 11, 2001 with
an annual day of service in a new format. We hope you'll join us in a
restorative month of service, learning about local causes, and committing
to improving our community - together. We are calling September's
month-long initiative: United We Help!

[23]Give your Time and Talents: Volunteer with us

[24]

We have reached 57 NEW monthly donors, which means we are 29% toward our
goal of 200! Who do you know that would like to be a part of this generous
group of do-gooders?

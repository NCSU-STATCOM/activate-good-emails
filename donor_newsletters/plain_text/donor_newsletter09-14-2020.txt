﻿Behind the Scenes at Activate Good

[16]Amber Smith recording at Attended Events studio

For our United We Help 9/11 Virtual Commemoration (which you can see
[17]HERE if you missed it!), we partnered with [18]Attended Events to help
us produce and air the event. Attended Events' mission is "to rid the world
of mediocre experiences." (love that!)

They have a Downtown Raleigh Virtual Event Studio where they produce
virtual events in the time of COVID.

Join us throughout September!

[20]United We Help

This year, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Activate Good is
continuing its tradition of honoring those lost on September 11, 2001 with
an annual day of service in a new format. We hope you'll join us in a
restorative month of service, learning about local causes, and committing
to improving our community - together. We are calling September's
month-long initiative: [21]United We Help!

[22]Give Your Time and Talents: Volunteer with Us

[23]

We have reached 79 NEW monthly donors, which means we've almost reached 40%
of our goal of 200!

Our first 100 donors - including YOU! - will get the special privilege of
helping us give a NAME to the [24]MONTHLY GIVING PROGRAM.

Start thinking now, and we will send out a poll once we reach 100. If you
know anyone who would like to help us with the naming, please invite them
to join as a monthly donor!

We believe we all have a responsibility to work towards a better world.
That’s why Activate Good improves our community through people-powered
projects for good.

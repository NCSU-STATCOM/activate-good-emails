﻿Behind the Scenes at Activate Good﻿

Teens and their parents (and my mom, Vickie!) helped us prep for [7]Family
Volunteer Day. We assembled a few of the kits that will be available,
including Hygiene Baggies for People Experiencing Homelessness, Decorated
Holiday Message for Seniors, Good in a Flash Student Study Kits, Wreaths
for a Family’s New Home, Adoptable Pet Care Packs, No Place Like Home
String Art Kits! We hope to see you on Family Volunteer Day - Saturday,
November 21, 2020.

Below, watch Amber talk to the volunteers about why their help was so
important.

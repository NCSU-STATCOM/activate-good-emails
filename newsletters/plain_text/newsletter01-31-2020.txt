Activate Good News | February 2020

IT'S HAPPENING

We are SO EXCITED to finally announce our first major step towards
realizing the Good Hub dream:

The Good Hub POP UP, coming this March and April!

Thanks to the generosity of [2]Colliers International Raleigh Durham, we
will be able to pilot-test a few of the core features of the future Good
Hub this spring in a temporary location -- 702 Oberlin Road in Raleigh --
and we want YOU to join us! We're in the process of developing our Good Hub
POP UP schedule now, but keep an eye on [3]our Good Hub site for more
information in the coming days to learn how you can visit for a tour,
participate in (or collaborate on!) a special event in the space, or drop
in with your friends and family.

Special thanks to [4]Oak City Productions for creating this announcement
video for us and helping us make this announcement in style!

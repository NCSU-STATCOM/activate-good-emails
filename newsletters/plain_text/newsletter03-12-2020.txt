Response to COVID-19

Activate Good takes the spread of COVID-19 very seriously. We are also
seeing the deep impact the loss of volunteer support is having on the
critical work of the nonprofit partners we serve in our community.

Learn about the measures we're taking to protect staff and volunteers, our
continuing mission to serve our nonprofit partners who need volunteers now
more than ever, and how we're handling activities in our newly launched
Good Hub POP UP [3]here.

Activate Good will continue its mission of supporting local nonprofits and
connecting volunteers in good health to fulfill their needs to the extent
that is possible and safe at this time. We are also compiling a list of
ways that volunteers can continue providing critical support to area
nonprofits through [4]remote volunteer opportunities and hope you will
consider helping in these ways if you are able. This ongoing list of remote
volunteer needs can be seen [5]here.

Thank you all for the amazing support you give Activate Good and causes in
our community every day. Please stay tuned for additional ways we can work
to support each other during this time while staying safe as a community.

The Good Hub POP UP

At this time, Activate Good plans to keep The Good Hub POP UP space located
at 702 Oberlin Road (Suite 400) in Raleigh open on its designated [6]open
days. We urge visitors and volunteers to adhere to common-sense practices
(shared [7]here) and exercise their best judgment when determining whether
or not to visit our space. Please continue to check [8]our website for any
updates before your visit.

Visiting The Good Hub POP UP

Check out our [9]Good Hub Pop Up Schedule for information about how you can
visit for a tour, participate in a special event in the space, or drop in
with your friends and family.

[10]ï»¿[11]The Good Hub POP UP is located at a temporary space at 702 Oberlin
Road, Suite 400 (4th Floor) in Raleigh through March and April.

Enormous gratitude goes to [12]Anthony Property Group

for providing the space for The Good Hub POP UP this spring!

March Volunteer

Opportunity Highlights

Volunteer support for Triangle area causes is dropping rapidly in response
to the community's concerns over the spread of Coronavirus. Our community's
most vulnerable populations will be greatly impacted by this dramatic
decrease in support. This month, Activate Good is highlighting many of the
ways you can [14]help the community, including ways to help remotely from
your home or workspace.

[15]To continue regular volunteering

If you are able, please consider supporting local nonprofits by
volunteering in person. Please note each nonprofit partner may have a
different policy regarding their activities due to COVID-19. Please be sure
to inquire about your nonprofit host's policy in the event you choose to
sign up to volunteer. Browse regular volunteer needs [16]here.

[17]Remote volunteering

If you are in good health but your work or circumstances have required you
to cancel or opt out of other public activities, other ways you can
continue to support area causes in this time of need are on [18]this list.

[19]View all current opportunities to make an impact

[20]Activate Good is a nonprofit activating volunteers to help charitable
causes in our local community. We connect individuals, groups, and
companies to fulfill volunteer needs with over 500 nonprofits around the
Triangle!

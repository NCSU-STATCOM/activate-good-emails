"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."

-Theodore Roosevelt

Activate Good has always believed and lived by the idea that anybody can do
good for others, for their community, and for the world. We've always known
that volunteers played a critical role in keeping our community going, but
we're seeing that amplified in a time when we can't go out, connect, and
gather to do good.

But, we can still do some good.

If you are in good health, and are in a position to do so, we invite you to
volunteer to meet our community's needs to the best of your ability from
home. To 'do what we can, with what we have, where we are', in the words of
Theodore Roosevelt. There are still ways you can support area causes
remotely - whether you have 5 minutes or several hours - and in a time
where so many of us are feeling helpless even when we so want to help, that
will make a big difference and put our community in a stronger position for
when we all emerge from this.

We have an ongoing list of urgent community needs and remote needs
[2]linked here. If you also may be interested in participating in one of
the larger-scale remote volunteer projects we're working on developing, let
us know [3]here.

Maybe we can't be with each other right now, but we can still help each
other in ways big and small. Let's focus on that.

Stay safe,

Amber

Executive Director

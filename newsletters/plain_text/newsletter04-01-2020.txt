Remote Volunteer Heroes

This week, we're highlighting a few amazing locals doing what good they
can, with what they have, where they are:

"I wanted to volunteer because I really love to give back. In times like we
are facing it is very difficult to find opportunities where you can give
back.

Our kids painting messages on the sidewalks around our n’hood to bring a
little joy."

- Cesely Smith

"I’ve always believed that people come together during challenging times
and the COVID-19 Pandemic has been no exception! As the volunteer leader of
'Kindness Calls to Isolated Seniors,' we’ve engaged volunteers to connect
by phone with seniors in retirement communities to provide positive
conversations and even celebrate milestones, like 103rd birthdays!”

- Olivia Ecker

"I just wanted to do what I could to help during this pandemic and this
(volunteering) was a perfect fit. Glad I saw 'remote volunteer
opportunities' on WRAL.Com!"

- Kristine Paro﻿

Thanks, Raleigh Magazine!

Earlier this year, we opened The [13]Good Hub POP UP, a temporary space
used to pilot test few of the core features of the future Good Hub, an
inclusive community learning and action space dedicated to connecting
locals to impactful volunteer opportunities. Even though the POP UP is
temporarily closed due to efforts to flatten the curve and COVID-19
distancing restrictions, the dream is still alive and you can read more
about it in [14]Raleigh Magazine's feature. We will see you there when we
can safely gather again!

Also: Check out Raleigh Magazine's profile of [15]30 in their 30's, an
inspiring group of young people (including our very own Founder and
Executive Director, Amber Smith!) who get "up each morning and making
Raleigh a better city for us all."

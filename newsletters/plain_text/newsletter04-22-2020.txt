Happy Volunteer Week!

This month, we'd like to recognize the awesome power of volunteers who are
finding ways to step up despite obstacles. Together we are building
stronger, more resilient communities! Now more than ever, we appreciate
YOU, our volunteers. Check out our Volunteer Thank You video below:

This week, we're highlighting more amazing locals doing what good they can,
with what they have, where they are:

"Coming from a family of teachers, I know the value of education and the
impact good role models can have in shaping the youth to be servant leaders
for their communities. These are challenging times and it's a privilege to
have the opportunity to help out.

The attached is a picture of me and my dad. He's a teacher in Connecticut,
and I spoke to his class about leadership earlier this year."

~ 2nd Lt Laffin, Michael F., USMC

"I recently moved to the Raleigh/Durham area! I am eager to get to know the
many non-profit organizations in the area and want to use my skills to get
involved in any way possible. With COVID-19 spreading rapidly, we are all
in a state of uncertainty. I believe these are the times we are to focus on
community, love, and fellowship to make it through to a brighter future."

~ Angela Martin

"﻿My family and I are signing up to make and send cards :) Two of our three
children have had hospital visits and each time, the kindness of others
helped comfort us during those difficult times. We are so excited to
hopefully be able to help give that to others."

~ Dominique Primus

"This work means SO much to teachers in Wake County. I am a kindergarten
teacher and almost half my class will be relying on these devices for
internet access at home, so I cannot thank you all enough!! Thank you
volunteers, and thank you Activate Good!" - Wake County Teacher

It's a wrap! Activate Good was excited to partner with WCPSS to recruit and
coordinate volunteers to help configure thousands of WiFi hotspots. Within
48 hours of putting out the call for volunteers, we saw a wave of people
sign up!

The partnership between Activate Good and WCPSS, along with the countless
volunteers, is a prime example of what can happen when organizations work
together. Over 250 volunteers participated over 4 days, gave over 1,200
volunteer hours in total, and configured 10,500 hotspots which are being
picked up by schools today!

Thank you to all the volunteers that helped!

NEW Project! [2]Operation Hand Up

Activate Good + Oak City Cares Call for Volunteers

Activate Good is partnering with [3]Oak City Cares to assist those
experiencing temporary or long-term homelessness. Without access to
technology, some clients have been unable to complete their applications
for stimulus or unemployment support that could make a huge difference to
their ability to survive and sustain themselves during these challenging
times! We're looking for volunteers to help us give these friends a
"[4]hand up" by helping them file for support one or more mornings at Oak
City Cares in downtown Raleigh, May 4 through May 8.

[5]

Volunteers will help these neighbors in need complete their applications to
receive their stimulus payment or unemployment support using a laptop
provided to them. Learn more about what volunteers will do, requirements,
and sign up for a shift time on our [6]Operation Hand Up page.

With your help, dozens of neighbors experiencing homelessness and hardship
can access their stimulus or unemployment support!

Special thank you to Michael and Ashlie Bucy for their support of this
critical initiative.

﻿Join us May 5 for our Facebook Live Charity Concert with Chris Hendricks!

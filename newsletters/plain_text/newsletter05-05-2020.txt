[2]Homebody: A Chris Hendricks #GivingTuesdayNow Charity Concert benefiting
Activate Good

with amazing and talented local musician, [3]Chris Hendricks

[4]

Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, [5]Activate Good had to cancel its Spring
Fundraiser as well as postpone other events that would have brought in
critical funding to allow us to continue our work. Help us raise $2,500 to
help us make up for some of this lost funding to continue our work!

HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ONLINE CONCERT

This is a free concert, but we encourage anyone who is able to [8]donate
any amount to Activate Good to help us meet our goal. Every penny helps!!!

HOW YOUR DONATIONS CREATE A RIPPLE OF IMPACT

Your support is an investment in the people, places, and future of the
Triangle. Your support will enable us to take on projects just like...

Operation Access: Our initiative completed mid-April in partnership with
Wake County Public School Systems to mobilize volunteers to prep 10,000+
hotspots so kids without internet access could learn from home alongside
their peers.

Operation Hand Up: Our current initiative to mobilize volunteers to help
dozens of neighbors experiencing homelessness apply for stimulus and
unemployment support.

Teens Change the World: Our initiative that mobilizes Triangle area teens
in service and provides community leadership training so they can become
the next generation of local changemakers!

...And SO much more in service to hundreds of needs and causes around the
Triangle! Thank you for any amount [12]you can give during these
challenging times. Every penny, every dollar helps immensely.

Donate with confidence! Did you know? We also have a Platinum seal of
nonprofit transparency on Guidestar (the highest possible seal!). [13]Check
us out.

Volunteer Opportunities

[14]Supply Drive for Boys & Girls Clubs

Rally your neighbors and friends to collect art, school, and cleaning

[15]Research to help find Grants and Donations

[17]Courage Cards for Teens

[18]Zach's Toy Chest has encouraged us to uplift teens in the hospital by
writing funny cards and including a small gift, if possible.

﻿P.S. - Did you know, Chris Hendricks is the artist who wrote and performed
this super song in our [19]2017 Volunteer Music Video?!

volunteer needs with over 500 nonprofits around the Triangle!

NEW Remote Volunteer Project!

[2]Virtual Storytime Readers needed

Activate Good is partnering with [3]Learning Together to empower future
readers! We’re looking for volunteers to model read aloud practices by
creating videos showcasing you reading a story in a fun, engaging way.

This project is great for individual volunteers (ages 12 and up!) OR groups
/ families, with the ability to record teleconferenced videos! Great for
team-building!

Skills Needed: Ability to read and a desire to spend time inspiring
children to read!

Equipment or Materials Needed:
* Pre-K/ Kindergarten books
* A recording device (phone, tablet, computer, etc.)
* BONUS (Not required): We encourage you to get creative with your attire
(wear a hat, costume, etc), background, etc. - perhaps theme all of this
based on the book you choose to read!

An Activate Good Photojournalism Project Featuring Triangle Volunteers of
the COVID-19 Pandemic﻿

﻿

In partnership with a Photojournalism intern this summer, Activate Good is
creating a collection of photos and stories about the good getting done
around the Triangle by volunteers amidst the pandemic. We're tentatively
calling this the "Look for the Helpers" project!

We're looking for sites our Photojournalist can visit to capture photos and
stories about volunteers and service around the Triangle between May 26 and
July 8, 2020 -- specifically nonprofits or schools where volunteers are
serving (even in smaller numbers), or even individuals or groups
volunteering remotely! Learn more about our criteria [13]here.

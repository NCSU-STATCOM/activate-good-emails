Update on our

Teens Change the World! Summer Program

[2]

We are changing things up in what we HOPE will be an exciting and impactful
way!

Due to COVID-19, Activate Good has decided to convert this year’s summer
program into a year-round teen service and leadership program that invites
teens to join us for supervised group service projects with multiple causes
around the Triangle! This will allow teens to keep engaging with their
community and helping local causes through service when it is safe to
participate, and in potentially smaller group sizes if needed -- throughout
the year. In this format, teens can join in for as many or as few events as
they'd like, complete any necessary service hours, learn about and
experience a variety of causes in the region, AND invite their friends to
join in!

Think your teens might be interested in this NEW format?

Complete our interest form [3]HERE.

We'll be sharing updates over the coming weeks.

Although we are sad that we won't have a camp this summer, we are excited
about exploring new ways to engage young do-gooders!

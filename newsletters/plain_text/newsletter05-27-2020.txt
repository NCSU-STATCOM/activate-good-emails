Sharing top insights from our Community Partner Coronavirus Challenges
Report

﻿

﻿In April 2020, the Activate Good team conducted interviews with 45 local
nonprofits to take the pulse on our community partner network. The purpose
of these interviews was to assess how Activate Good can be impactful and
effective in our work to mobilize volunteers to support the community, both
in the coming months and long-term. These interviews allowed us to
understand our Community Partners’ needs and explore the possibilities of
how volunteers can be a part of helping the Triangle become stronger during
the Coronavirus pandemic and into the future.

Learn more about Activate Good's plans to meet community needs and our top
insights from our interviews in our new [2]Community Partner Coronavirus
Challenges report.

﻿Activate Good is excited to partner with [4]Art Intimacy, a nonprofit arts
learning organization that provides mental and educational tools to prepare
youth for future success. We are working together to get arts, crafts, and
school supplies into the hands of 100 local kids! We already have
volunteers for this project, but here are other ways you can help:

Donate Art Supplies!

the SmART Supply Drive Donation Box at Loading Dock Raleigh (1053 E.
Whitaker Mill Road, Suite 115, Raleigh) Mondays – Fridays between 9 AM and

A Summer of Socially-Distanced Service

Summer isn’t canceled! Are you looking for something to do this summer?
Since many camps, events, and gatherings have been canceled, we compiled a
list of remote, social distance-friendly, or DIY volunteer projects. These
opportunities are safe, helpful, and fun for all ages!

Remember that survey we sent out last spring to understand why folks around
the Triangle volunteer (or their barriers to getting involved)? Our deep
dive assessment of over 1,000 responses is now complete! Check out our full
results and findings [16]here.﻿

We believe we all have a responsibility to work towards a better world.
That’s why [18]Activate Good improves our community through people-powered
projects for good.

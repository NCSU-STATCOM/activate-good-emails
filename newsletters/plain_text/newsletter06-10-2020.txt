Highlighting 11 Black-led Community Partners

Activate Good would like to take this opportunity to shine a light on a
handful of our Black-led Community Partners and their dynamic leaders.
These executive directors show us every day what it means to be doing the
work, and we support them. We encourage you to take a moment to learn more
about these organizations, the critical work they do for the Triangle
community, and consider volunteering or donating to their causes.

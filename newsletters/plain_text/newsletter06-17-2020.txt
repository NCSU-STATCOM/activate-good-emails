﻿Fight Food Waste & Tackle Hunger:

﻿Become a 'Middle Mile' Volunteer Driver

Hunger isn't going away this summer, but here's something you can do about
that.﻿

Activate Good is partnering with the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North
Carolina to fight food waste and food insecurity in the Triangle. Hundreds
of local families still lack access to fresh food while farms, restaurants,
catering services, and others sometimes have excess food they don't need.

Sign up to be a [3]Middle Mile driver and use your vehicle to help get
extra food from these destinations to food pantries! A smartphone app will
alert you when a food pick-up is needed -- Then, you decide whether you are
able to assist at that time when the alert comes through! This is an
excellent opportunity for retirees, freelancers and others who have
flexible schedules. And, it's a way to help meet a critical need while
practicing safe social distancing.

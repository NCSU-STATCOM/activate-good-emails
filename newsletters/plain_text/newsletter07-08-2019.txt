The [7]Teens Change the World! Summer Program is a week-long service and
leadership experience that will give teens the opportunity to volunteer
with different nonprofits (15 service hours in one week!), learn about a
variety of local causes, learn from social impact and business experts, and
even pitch their ideas for social impact for the chance to win a small
grant to execute their idea!

A number of scholarships are available.

[4]﻿Operation Summer Hunger[5]﻿

[6]

﻿Did you know? About 30% of Wake County Public School students qualify for
the free and reduced lunch program. Many of these children rely on food
from school to meet their needs, often experiencing hunger at home. With
COVID-19 being another factor this year, things are really tough for a lot
of families with school-aged children.

[7]﻿Operation Summer Hunger is Activate Good’s call for volunteers to help
us make sure our neighbors are fed! Check out opportunities to help
hunger-fighting organizations continue their work. Choose from garden days,
food pantry organization, data management, produce sorting, meal delivery,
and more.

Check out Operation Summer Hunger volunteer opportunities [8]here!

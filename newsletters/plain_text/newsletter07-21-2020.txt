[2]Operation Summer Hunger

﻿

[3]

Did you know? About 30% of Wake County Public School students qualify for
the free and reduced lunch program. Many of these children rely on food
from school to meet their needs, often experiencing hunger at home. This
becomes an even greater issue during breaks and holidays – especially over
the long summer break. With COVID-19 being another factor this year, things
are really tough for a lot of families with school-aged children.

[4]Operation Summer Hunger is Activate Good’s call for volunteers to help
us make sure our neighbors are fed! Check out opportunities to help
hunger-fighting organizations continue their work. Choose from garden days,
food pantry organization, data management, produce sorting, meal delivery,
and more.

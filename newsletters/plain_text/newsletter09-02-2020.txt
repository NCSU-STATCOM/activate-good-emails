Monthly Giving Program - amplify your impact!

[26]

Did you know? If we can recruit 200 new Monthly givers, we'll earn a
challenge grant of $25,000! Help us meet our goal - join by completing
[27]this form!

Invest in our impacts with accessible [28]monthly donations of $5, $10, $20
(or other amounts!) — while seeing your investments at work and being part
of a [29]generous community of like-minded do-gooders in our area.

Fun fact: If you sign up as a monthly giver and choose for your membership
to be part of our [30]Youth Givers Program, we’ll address our thank you
note and future correspondence to your child as a fun way of including them
in the giving process!

We believe we all have a responsibility to work towards a better world.
That’s why [31]Activate Good improves our community through people-powered
projects for good.

Help us earn a $25,000 Challenge Grant -

﻿Join our Monthly Giving Community

﻿We need your help!

In a COVID-19 world, Activate Good is no longer able to raise funds through
events the way we have in the past. So we're inviting folks to invest in
our impacts with accessible [2]monthly donations of $5, $10, $20 (or other
amounts!) -- while seeing your investments at work and being part of a
generous community of like-minded do-gooders in our area. Every $1 donated
to Activate Good creates a value of at least $3 in community impacts!

﻿Here's what's going on: We've been offered a generous challenge
grant. [3]If 200 new monthly givers join us in this monthly giving program,
one of our amazing donors will make an additional gift of $25,000 to
support our work!

We're already on our way - 68 new monthly givers have joined in! [4]Will
you join and help us meet our goal of reaching 100 givers (just 32 more!)
this month? Our first 100 monthly donors will get to help us name the
monthly giving community, so start brainstorming!

[5]Be one of our first 100 (and help us name this community!)

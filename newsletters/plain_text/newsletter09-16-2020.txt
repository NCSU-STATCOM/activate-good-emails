You're invited to be a part of something special:

Our Monthly Giving Community!

In a COVID-19 world, Activate Good is no longer able to raise funds through
events the way we have in the past. So we're inviting folks to invest in
our impacts with accessible [2]monthly donations of $5, $10, $20 (or other
amounts!) -- while seeing your investments at work and being part of a
generous community of like-minded do-gooders in our area.

﻿Here's the deal: We've been offered a generous challenge grant. [3]If
200 new Monthly Donors join us in the monthly giving program, one of our
amazing supporters will make an additional gift of $25,000!

We're already on our way - 79 new monthly givers have joined in! [4]Will
you join and help us meet our goal of reaching 100 givers in September?
Join now and you can help us pick the official name of our monthly giving
community!

[5]Be one of our first 100 (and help us name this community!)

Youth Giving Program

﻿

﻿Did you know?

Research shows that involving young people in philanthropy at a young age
increases the likelihood that they'll engage in service and leadership as
adults. Learn more in our most recent [6]blog post!

When you join our [7]monthly giving community, you can choose to donate in
your child's name, and we will address our thank you note and future
correspondence to your child as a fun way of including them in the giving
process. Watch Lucy open her card!

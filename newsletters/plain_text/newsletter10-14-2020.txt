﻿We need your help!

[5]Will you join and help us meet our HALFWAY goal of reaching 100 givers
(just 1 more!) this month? Our first 100 monthly donors will get to help us
name the monthly giving community, so start brainstorming.

﻿When we reach 200, we will get our challenge grant of $25,000!

Save the Date! November 21 is Family Volunteer Day, the "Take-Home Service
Project Kit" Edition!

This year, Activate Good's annual Family Volunteer Day will be on Saturday,
November 21, but in a NEW socially-distanced format - with
pick-up-and-take-home service project kits and other goodies for families
with kids of all ages to enjoy! These Take-Home Service Project kits will
be available on a pay-what-you-can donation amount basis to help Activate
Good cover the costs of materials and hosting the socially-distanced kit
pick-up event.

We'll announce how the event will work soon. Want to get an alert when we
do? Complete our [8]Family Volunteer Day alerts form here.

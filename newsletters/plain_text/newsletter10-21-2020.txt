with pick-up-and-take-home service project kits and other goodies for
families with kids of all ages to enjoy! These Take-Home Service Project
kits will be available on a pay-what-you-can donation amount basis to help
Activate Good cover the costs of materials and hosting the
socially-distanced kit pick-up event.

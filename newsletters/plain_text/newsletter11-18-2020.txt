Activate MORE Good: Tell us your Stories of GOOD!

[2]

On Giving Tuesday, we will be launching our year end fundraising campaign,
[3]Activate MORE Good. As part of the campaign, we want to share stories of
GOOD from 2020 to countdown to MORE good in 2021!

Do you have a story about how Activate Good impacted you in any way - big
or small - in 2020 (eg. provided a sense of meaning during COVID, helped
you make a new friend, etc)? We've partnered with Gather Voices to make
uploading a video testimonial quick and easy:

1) Individual volunteers, donors, community members: Click [4]HERE to share
your video story!

2) Nonprofit and community partners: Click [5]HERE to share your video
story!

It's [6]Hunger & Homelessness Awareness Week!

﻿Activate MORE Good campaign

[2]Amber explains Activate MORE Good

We're excited to kick off [3]Activate MORE Good, our year-end campaign to
fund Activate Good projects to meet the Triangle’s critical needs in 2021.

We [4]need YOUR help to reach our goal!

When you [5]give to Activate Good, you power our service initiatives –
projects that combat food insecurity and homelessness, bolster education,
support kids and families, and mobilize people of all ages to create
positive change in the Triangle.

And here’s some more good news: If at least 90 more donors either join as
monthly givers or give an amount matching what you project you would have
given over a year, Activate Good will earn a challenge grant of $25,000
from one of our generous supporters!

Activate Good has partnered with the State of North Carolina and
VolunteerNC to host a series of Virtual Volunteer Expos -- virtual
"volunteer fairs" that provide information to community members who may be
interested in volunteering.

The first [8]Virtual Volunteer Expo is December 9th at 12PM.

You'll hear from a group of local nonprofits who will each share their
organization's mission, current volunteer needs, and ways you can get
involved safely. After hearing from each nonprofit presenter, you'll have
the option of joining Zoom Breakout Rooms to talk more in-depth to the
organizations that interest you.

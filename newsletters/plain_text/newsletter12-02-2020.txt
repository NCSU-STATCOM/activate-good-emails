Activate Good has partnered with the State of North Carolina and
VolunteerNC to host a series of Virtual Volunteer Expos -- virtual
"volunteer fairs" that provide information to community members who may be
interested in volunteering. [2]Join us for our first Expo on December 9!

[3]

You'll hear from a group of local nonprofits who will each share their
organization's mission, current volunteer needs, and ways you can get
involved safely. After hearing from each nonprofit presenter, you'll have
the option of joining Zoom Breakout Rooms to talk more in-depth to the
organizations that interest you.

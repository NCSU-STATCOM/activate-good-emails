Activate Good News | December 2019

[2]#GivingTuesday

[3]Support our work to help build a community

of compassion in action

What if we could live in a community in which every person truly saw the
power they had to create positive change--and was taking action to make the
world a better place?

This is the vision that drives [4]Activate Good. We don't promote
volunteering just because it's a "good thing to do". We inspire, encourage,
and connect locals to service because everyone taking action makes the
whole community better for all.

Connect thousands of volunteers to [10]over 500 causes in the Triangle each

impact service project, which we fund and provide mentorship to execute
afterward.

[2]Activate MORE Good

When we look back at 2020, it’s easy to think of the bad things that
happened – but we’re here to tell you that because of your passion, action,
and support, a lot of good got done, too. As part of our Activate MORE Good
year-end campaign, we’re celebrating the good things we accomplished
together in 2020 with 21 stories of good.

Visit [3]www.activategood.org/activatemoregood throughout December to
contribute to our work and see all 21 stories as we unveil them! Check out
two stories - one from Activate Good volunteer project leader Meka, and
another from Kevin with WCPSS, below.

When you give to Activate Good, you [6]power our service initiatives -
projects that combat food insecurity and homelessness, bolster education,
support kids and families, and mobilize people of all ages to create
positive change in the Triangle.

We only need 74 MORE donors to get a challenge grant of $25,000! Will you
join us?

Introducing: Donate Stocks

Activate Good is excited to announce an exciting new giving opportunity -
our capability to accept stock donations!

While tax laws are constantly changing, we felt that this was an imperative
tool that we wanted to place in our donors' toolbox, as this may provide
you specific tax benefits all while helping to fuel People-Powered Projects
in the Triangle. (Be sure to consult your tax professional before engaging
in this transaction).

In order to help continue our mission, please contact our [8]Development
Coordinator, Lee Posey Pike directly for specific instructions on how to
participate in this program or [9]download this form to get started.

The LAST [10]Activate Good Virtual Town Hall of 2020 will be December 30 at
5:30pm. Join us and invite your friends!

Counting down to 2021

"In just a couple of days, [Activate Good] was able to galvanize many many
volunteers that came in and helped us set [the hotspots] up - and did so in
such a pleasant and cheerful way that it lifted everybody's spirits!"

- Kevin Harvey, Technology Services, Wake County Public Schools

Our 21 Stories of Good to ring in the new year continue with Kevin's story
(click the image above to watch!) At the beginning of the pandemic, we
teamed up with Wake County Public Schools to mobilize volunteers to
configure WiFi hotspots so over 10,000 students with out reliable internet
access could learn remotely.

As 2020 (and our [3]Activate MORE Good campaign) comes to a close, we're
already planning more large-scale COVID-19 relief and community projects
like that one, and could use your help! Help us reach our fundraising goal
by December 31 with a [4]one-time or [5]recurring contribution and we'll
unlock a challenge grant of $25,000 from one of our generous donors!

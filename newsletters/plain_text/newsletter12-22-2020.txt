[3]Activate MORE Good

There's still time to contribute to our Activate MORE Good campaign!

We're excited to share that, thanks to our amazing donors so far, we've
raised enough in dollars to qualify for our challenge grant - Woohoo!!!

We're still aiming to welcome 200 new donors into our passionate, amazing
giving community this year - and we just need 70 more individual donors to
hit the mark! If you're in a position to do so, and want to help fuel the
work we do, we hope you'll consider joining with a [4]one-time or
[5]recurring donation!

Also: Visit our [6]Activate MORE Good page throughout December to see all
21 stories of GOOD, highlighting our impacts in the community this year.
Have you seen this video from a family who all volunteers together? (So
cute!)

End of Year giving: ﻿Donating Stocks

Activate Good is excited to announce our capability to accept stock
donations!

While tax laws are constantly changing, we felt that this was an imperative
tool that we wanted to place in our donors' toolbox, as this may provide
you specific tax benefits all while helping to fuel People-Powered Projects
in the Triangle. (Be sure to consult your tax professional before engaging
in this transaction).

Contact our [9]Development Coordinator, Lee Posey Pike directly for
specific instructions on how to participate in this program.

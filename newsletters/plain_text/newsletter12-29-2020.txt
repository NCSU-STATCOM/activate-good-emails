We're wishing you a Happy New Year and getting ready for 2021 - a year all
signs point to being a year of civic and community love unlike we've ever
seen before. In 2020, we saw the needs in our community rise to
unprecedented levels - and we also saw you rise to the occasion. So grab
your friends and get ready to do more good (whether it's virtually or
safely in-person!). We've got work to do!

# Trends in the Open Probability

We modeled the probability that a given subscriber will open a weekly newsletter within a week of its sent date. If the subscriber opens the newsletter after a week or uses the newsletter to unsubscribe, we consider it a non-open. 

```{r}
load("m4.RData")
```

```{r}
summary(m4)
```

```{r}
expit <- function(x){
  
  1/(1+exp(-x))
  
}

logit <- function(x){
  
  log(x / (1 - x))
  
}
```

```{r}
plot(m4, trans = expit, select = 4, main = "Effect of Time of Day on Open Probability", ylab = "Probability")
```

```{r}
plot_smooth(m4, view = "mins_since_midnight", transform = expit)
```

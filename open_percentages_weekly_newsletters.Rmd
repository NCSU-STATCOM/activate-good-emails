The open percentage is 

$$\mathrm{Open \ \%} = \frac{\mathrm{number \ of \ contacts \ who \ opened \ the \ email}}{\mathrm{number \ of \ contacts \ sent \ to}}$$

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```




```{r}
load("wrangled_data/weeklies1.RData")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = weeklies1, aes(x = time, y = contacts_sent_to)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Number of Contacts Sent To over Time, 2019-2020") + 
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Number of Contacts Sent To") +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_datetime(labels = date_format("%m/%y"), 
               breaks = date_breaks("2 month"))
  
```

When did the pandemic start changing things? The March 12 weekly newsletter was the first one to mention the COVID-19 pandemic and remote volunteering opportunities. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = weeklies1, aes(x = time, y = opened)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Open Percentage over Time, 2019-2020") + 
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Open Percentage") +
  scale_x_datetime(labels = date_format("%m/%y"), 
               breaks = date_breaks("2 month")) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.POSIXct("2020-03-01"), col = "red")
  
```

There is a spike in the open percentages after March.
